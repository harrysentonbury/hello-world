# hello-world

Just learnin git, but the code is useful all the same.

This here is a simplesque tone generator.
It takes 2 arguments:
  - Frequency in hertz.
  - Duration in seconds.

```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install sounddevice
```

Then run it in the terminal.

```
python3 tone_generator.py [frequency] [duration]
```
